## Dashboard with Next.js 14

We'll create a simplified version of a financial dashboard with the following features:

- A public home page.
- A login page.
- Authenticated protected dashboard pages.
- Users' ability to add, edit, and delete invoices.

The dashboard will also have an attached database.
